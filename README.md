This is my project page for my new and upcoming project. The gods guide to the world. 
Here's A little Overview of how the project works. 

The user will go onto the application and select a country they would be traveling to or at the place already, and from there it will show the current prices of hotels in the local area which other users have already updated. Prices are updated every day depending on how many users there are. What we are looking to include in this site is:

Hotel prices (List of hotels rated from 1-5 stars either the data will be gathered from users using the site and they give their rating or external sites such as trip advisor.)<br>
Petrol Prices<br>
Ticket prices for any parks or attractions<br>
In-Depth guide of the country, written by users to help tourists stay away from tourist traps and properly explore the country.<br>
Updates of current political tensions. Is it safe for a certain person from a certain country to travel to the one they are visiting? i.e South Korea to North Korea.<br>
How to stay safe in that country. i.e. certain snakes, animals, and certain foods may be harmful to people.<br>
Implementing google translate.<br>
Who to contact in an emergency with a list of emergency numbers a user can contact.<br>
What bank cards work in a certain country.<br>
What phone services work in a certain country.<br>
